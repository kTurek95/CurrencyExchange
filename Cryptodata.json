Xaurum is meant to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.\n\nThe former cryptocurrency, Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR. \n\nIn this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them. \n\nWhen mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies are used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold. The proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself. \n\nWhen minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not maintain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.\n\nProfits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself."}}, {"model": "CryptoCurrencies.cryptotokencurrency", "pk": 626, "fields": {"code": "BFX", "name": "BitFinex Tokens", "description": "BitFinex Tokens were issued by BitFinex as obligations by the exchange for the 36% haircut on customer account after the hack in August 2016\\.

Free-flowing information and ideas are almost always catalysts for the next stages of societal evolution and exponential technological growth. Online censorship today ranges from something as small as a single blocked tweet all the way up to a full corporate website being banned if the messaging doesn’t fit an individual platforms definition of appropriate.\n\nThe Solution:\n\nGiving the power back to society via consensus to determine a broader definition of appropriate information and messaging is the project goal. It has accomplished this in three ways:\n\n-Decentralize content & storage hosting, so no single entity has control over what is appropriate.\n\n-Utilize community and user consensus to moderate this decentrally stored content.\n\n-Maintain a closed-loop economy around steps one and two to encourage participation, reward contribution and network utilization.\n\nDecentralized Content & Storage Network:\n\nAt the core, the Ether-1 Network is built on top of an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain, utilizing a hybrid POW (proof-of-work) consensus mechanism and a network of community-owned collateralized nodes which all contribute storage and bandwidth to the network.\n\nDecentralized Governance for Content Moderation:\n\nPure free-speech and anti-censorship comes at the cost of any piece of data being allowed on the network unchecked. It balances this with allowing collateralized node/network participants to moderate content based on on-chain decentralized voting. Governance participants are rewarded for their participation in the system.\n\nEconomy Built to Reward Participation and Utilization:\n\nAll network participants are rewarded monetarily in our native coin (ETHO) for their contributions.

The network is powered by a family of stablecoins, each pegged to major fiat currencies all algorithmically stabilized by Terra’s native token, Luna. Terra’s mission is to set money free by building open financial infrastructure. Luna, as the native staking asset from which the family of Terra stablecoins derives their stability, utility, and value, acts both as collateral for the entire Terra economy and as a staking token that secures the PoS network. Luna can be held and traded like a normal crypto asset, but can also be staked to accrue rewards in the network generated from transaction fees. Luna can also be used to make and vote on governance proposals.\n\nThe family of Terra stablecoins is designed to achieve stability through consistent mining rewards with a contracting and expanding money supply. For example, if the system has detected that the price of a Terra currency has deviated from its peg, it applies pressure to normalize the price. Currently, the family of Terra stablecoins includes: KRT (Terra stablecoin pegged to Korean Won), UST (Terra stablecoin pegged to US Dollar), MNT (Terra stablecoin pegged to Mongolian Togrog), SDR (Terra stablecoin pegged to IMF SDR), with more being added in the future."}}, {"model": "CryptoCurrencies.cryptotokencurrency", "pk": 4321, "fields": {"code": "FORESTPLUS", "name": "The Forbidden Forest", "description": "Forest is an opened development community, mainly combined by developers from various regions and countries.

By bridging the gap between decentralized finance and traditional finance, Cover Protocol aims to open the doors of DeFi to all investors.\n\n**The COVER Token and Migrations (SAFE2 to COVER)**\n\nThe exact token distribution can be found here. In our original plans, we had a tentative amount of 55,000 $COVER to be migrated. However, the amount of $COVER eligible in the snapshot for claiming (for those who missed the $SAFE =>$SAFE2 migration) was lower than expected by 150 tokens. For now, this difference of 150 $COVER will be minted to the treasury and we will hold a vote for $COVER holders to decide on what we do with these tokens.\n\nOn release, $SAFE2 holders can migrate to $COVER while those who missed the $SAFE -> $SAFE2 migration will be eligible to claim a partial amount of their snapshotted balance. There will be a MIGRATE button on the left bottom of the side nav.\n\n<br>\n<em>This page refers to the updated version of COVER.

Your contribution to MurAll will be on the blockchain in its history for as long as the blockchain lives (i.e. you will always be able to see your contribution there in the history, even if someone draws over your pixels). When you draw, you also get a MURALL Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of your contribution, a token containing your drawing, which you own and are free to do with as you please - hold, display, trade, collect, the choice is yours.

It was formed by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors who were motivated by the idea of using blockchain technology to facilitate the collective ownership and management of rare assets. ConstitutionDAO conducted a fundraising campaign in Ether cryptocurrency, raising $47 million. However, it was unsuccessful in its bid to purchase the Constitution at a Sotheby's auction, ultimately losing to a higher bid of $43.2 million. Following this, ConstitutionDAO was disbanded​​​​.\n\n## What is ConstitutionDAO (PEOPLE) used for?\nThe primary use of ConstitutionDAO was to pool resources for the collective purchase and management of rare assets, specifically an original copy of the U.S. Constitution. Participants in the project purchased $PEOPLE tokens, the native token of ConstitutionDAO, which granted them voting rights and a fractional ownership in the asset the DAO aimed to acquire. The governance structure of ConstitutionDAO was community-driven, allowing token holders to propose and vote on decisions regarding the management of the assets held by the DAO. This decision-making process was based on a liquid democracy model, designed to enhance participation and efficiency in governance​​.\n\n## Who created ConstitutionDAO (PEOPLE)?\nConstitutionDAO was initiated by Trent Griffin, a well-known cryptocurrency investor, and was subsequently developed by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. The idea quickly gained traction within the cryptocurrency community, leading to the formation of the DAO and its first fundraising round in November 2021.
